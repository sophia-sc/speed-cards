# Speed Cards Training App
By Sophia Schwandt

## Introduction to speed cards
Speed cards is a memory competition that takes place at the annual **World Memory Championships**, during which 
competitors must memorize the order of a shuffled deck of cards as fast as possible. The completion of speed cards in 
under 2 minutes is a requirement to earn the title of **International Master of Memory**. Participants utilise various
mnemonic techniques to memorize cards. One such technique is the **Person-Action-Object (PAO)** deck, where each card is
associated with 3 concepts: a person, an action, and an object. Cards are memorized in groups of three, with the
person from card 1, action from card 2, and object from card 3 forming an image which can be stored in long-term
memory. Each participant has their own custom PAO deck, and practice is essential to achieve a low time.

## The Speed Cards Training App
The Speed Cards Training App is a tool made for people who want to learn speed cards using the PAO method. It allows
users to store their personalized PAO deck and edit it as needed. Users can practice timed memorization with a set of 
random cards of any length and view the correct image mapping.
